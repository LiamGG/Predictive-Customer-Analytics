# Upselling

Things to consider:
1. Items purchased together.
2. Similar customer demographics.
3. Life events.
4. Holidays and other yearly events.
5. Price / Brand preferences.

## Find items purchased together - not customer specific.
Place items bought together and recommend them to the customer.

Focus on itmes regularly bought in the same purchase, not by the same owner. This way you can create bundles, or offer sections that say "this item is usually bought with....".

*Algorithm*: Association Rules Mining / Market Basket Analysis.
This outputs rules that specify the dependency of one item to another.

##  Create customer group preferences.
What other categories will my new customer be interested in?

We can identify similar customers, and use their purchase history to recommend products they like to the new customer.

*Alogirhtm*: Clustering, e.g. K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbours.

1. Create cluster of customers to discover groups.
2. Predict what group the new customer falls into, using e.g. a tree based algorithm (random forest).
3. Recommend items (by popularity, count, Association Rules Mining, etc.)

1. Use demographics to group customers.
2. Use ARM to create rules linking groups to products.
3. Incorporate new customers into a group and recommend products.

## Collaborative filtering recommendation engines.
Works on three pieces of data:
1. User e.g. buyer / viewer
2. Item e.g. product / video
3. Affinity score between the user and the item e.g. whether the user buys / rating + mintues viewed + number of sessions.
